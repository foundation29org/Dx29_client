Let's try to explain what this means in a simple way. Maybe this explanation has some scientific inaccuracies, but we will try to make the language very clear and understandable.",
    "title2.1": "Genetic information and your furniture",
    "content2.1.1": "Just as houses are made of bricks, steel, glass and other materials, we humans are made of various elements, but we will focus on proteins. Proteins are the building blocks of our bodies. There are many types and each one has a particular function. Where does our body keep the instructions to make these proteins? In our DNA (DNA = DeoxyriboNucleic Acid).",
    "content2.1.2": "Imagine that you are assembling an Ikea chair. Inside the box there are various materials and a little white booklet with assembly instructions. Our cells work in a similar way. In our example, the chair we want to assemble is the protein and the little booklet with the instructions is the DNA to build it. So far everything is simple. But the wonderful thing about the human body is that we have over 20,000 types of furniture and parts to build the house. The cells store all this information in the their nuclei, which has the information needed to build all the parts of our body. How does the cell keep all this information organized and accessible?",
    "content2.1.3": "In our example, the furniture, the brick, a window are the basic building elements. In our cells this information is in the gene. A gene has the information to make a protein, which are the basic building blocks in our body. Our cells are constantly making them and throughout our lives.",
    "content2.1.4": "Cells do not keep all the instruction books in a chaotic way. They group together a set of instructions on a shelf. A shelf is a set of booklets with assembly instructions. The shelf is the chromosome; each book is a gene.",
    "content2.1.5": "We have 22 pairs of shelves and a couple of other shelves that are different depending on whether we are female or male. So why do we have a pair of shelves? Let's say that it's our parents' inheritance: we all inherit 22 pairs of shelves from our parents plus one extra pair according to their gender.",
    "content2.1.6": " The information we store on those shelves is huge. Genetic information can have four different letters (A C T G, which correspond to components of DNA). Well, we have three billion letters! So many that if we were to write the letters on sheets of paper and stack them all up, the height of all those sheets would be that of a multi-storey building.",
    "title3.1": "Genetic diseases",
    "content3.1": "Genetic diseases occur when there is a problem with those instructions. When cells divide, they have to make a copy of their DNA. This copying process often has errors. This - which looks like a problem - is an advantage because it is how evolution works and has made it possible for different species to develop, although it can also, as we will see, produce diseases.",
    "content3.2": "When sperm or eggs divide, each of us undergoes between 50 and 100 changes, called mutations. If these mutations occur in a minor part of the manual, we will not notice a major change. But if the mutation falls in a major area of the manual, the instructions in this case do change substantially and then two things can happen:",
    "content3.2.1": "if these new instructions make the furniture we build have some advantage, Ikea will incorporate them and the next versions of the furniture will incorporate them and be better furniture. This is the way living beings adapt to the environment, evolve and produce new species.",
    "content3.2.2": "if the mutation causes the instructions to make a drawer not close properly, a handle to be missing or a piece of furniture not to fit properly we will have a disease since the protein will not work properly and will cause a problem in the body.",
    "title4.1": "Genetic testing",
    "content4.1": "A genetic test is designed to find out if our furniture building instructions have any problems. Now we're going to quickly explain the different types of genetic tests that exist today.",
    "title4.2": "Karyotype",
    "content4.2": "By carrying out this test we check if we have the 22 pairs of shelves and the two extra chromosomes according to the sex. Sometimes we are missing a whole shelf and sometimes we have an extra shelf. Sometimes we are even missing a whole piece of a shelf. This is the first genetic test that was done and geneticists only need a microscope and a lot of skill to see the chromosomes. For example, Down's Syndrome - where there are three shelves of chromosome 21 - is diagnosed this way. Just because they do this test doesn't mean that our genetic information is right, because they are just looking at the shelves to see that they are correct and not broken. They're not looking at the books, the pages or the letters.",
    "title4.3": "Sanger's test",
    "content4.3": "It soon became apparent that it would be interesting to open the books and see if they had all the chapters, all the pages and all the letters. Fortunately, a technique was developed that allowed this to be done and geneticists could check the letters of a book. It was the most accurate technique until about ten years ago. The problem I had was that you could only look at one book at a time. The doctor had to look at the patient's symptoms and if they were related to a problem in a piece of furniture the doctor would look at that book and see if all the letters, all the instructions were OK. It was a laborious, slow and expensive task because you had to go letter by letter, but the big problem I had was that if the book was right we were back at the beginning of the road. We had to go through each book and remember that there are more than 20,000 books. This test is called Sanger after the scientist who discovered it. It's made to look at a single gene.",
    "title4.4": "Array",
    "content4.4": "The scientists realized that many diseases were caused by problems in the same chapters of the books. Faced with the need to look at several hundred books at once, they developed a technique capable of doing so, but only in specific parts since it was very expensive to read all the letters. By means of an array we can analyze books on all the shelves, but only very specific parts where we know there may be errors. If the error is elsewhere in the book we will not see it and the patient will remain undiagnosed.",
    "title4.5": "NGS (Next Generation Sequencing)",
    "content4.5": "Since 2005 the computers came to change everything. A technique was developed that allowed to analyze all the letters of all the books of all the shelves. As there are three billion letters and also with several copies, a lot of calculation capacity is needed to do it. Humans can't do it, but computers can. Within the NSW right now there are three types:",
    "title4.5.1": "Panels",
    "content4.5.1": "On one panel you select a few hundred genes, or books in our case, and you look at all the letters or all the instructions in each of the books. One by one. With that we can see if these genes have errors or not. We won't know if there are errors in other books, but at least we can rule out some of them. Usually doctors do these tests when they suspect a disease or a group of diseases. If we have a leak in a house upstairs we would look at all the components in the bathroom, but we would not look at the drawers in the living room.",
    "title4.5.2": "Medical exome",
    "content4.5.2": "It's a panel, but already with thousands of books. All the books that we know are related to known diseases. It allows us to diagnose diseases that have a gene and clearly connected symptoms. It's like looking at all the furniture in a house, maybe they have nothing to do with the problem, but we look at them anyway to see if we see anything.",
    "title4.5.3": "Exome",
    "content4.5.3": "Here you look at all the books and you see that all the letters are there. If we find a problem in a book that we know what furniture it makes and that furniture has a problem, then we have a diagnosis. If we find a problem in a book, but we don't know very well the function of the furniture inside the house we can't confirm the diagnosis, but we will have a suspicion. We will have to wait to see the result of this problem in more houses and see if the same symptoms are generated.",
    "title4.5.4": "Genome",
    "content4.5.4": "To jump from exome to genome I must confess that I have not told you everything. On the shelves besides the books there's a lot more information. Imagine that it is the shelf in your house where you have kept papers, bills, school notes, etc. It is information that is in our DNA but that many times we don't know what it does and what it is for. In a genome we analyze books, but we also read these papers. Right now we don't know what it's good for, but we store the information because in the future science can tell us after storing huge amounts of data. One of the functions attributed to these roles, called introns, is that they contain the information of when each book should be read.",
    "content4.6": "The biological reality is much more complicated and there are more possible genetic problems than those I have described. But we hope this information will help you to clarify concepts and make your next furniture purchase more entertaining."

    "section1.title": "1. Genetic information and your shelves",
    "section1.text1": "Just as houses are made of bricks, steel, glass and other materials, we humans are made of various elements, but we will focus on proteins. Proteins are the building blocks of our bodies. There are many types and each one has a particular function. Where does our body keep the instructions to make these proteins? In our DNA (DNA = DeoxyriboNucleic Acid).",
    "section1.text2": "Imagine you're assembling an Ikea chair. Inside the box there are several materials and a little white booklet with assembly instructions. Our cells work in a similar way. In our example, the chair we want to assemble is the protein and the little booklet with the instructions is the DNA to build it. So far everything is simple. But the wonderful thing about the human body is that we have over 20,000 types of furniture and parts to build the house. The cells store all this information in the nucleus of our cells, which has the information needed to build all the parts of our body. How does the cell keep all this information organized and accessible?",
    "section1.text3": "In our example, the furniture, the brick, a window are the basic building elements. In our cells, this information is in the genes. A gene has the information to make a protein, which are the basic building blocks in our body. Our cells are constantly making them throughout our lives.",
    "section1.text4": "Cells do not keep all the instruction books in a chaotic way. They group together a set of instructions on a shelf. A shelf is a set of booklets with assembly instructions. The shelf is the chromosome; each book is a gene.",
    "section1.text5": "We have 23 pairs of shelves and a couple of other shelves that are different depending on whether we are women or men. And why do we have a couple of shelves? Let's say it's our parents' heritage: we all inherit 23 pairs of shelves from our parents plus an extra one according to their sex.  ",
    "section1.text6": "The information we store on those shelves is huge. Genetic information can have four different letters (A C T G, which correspond to components of DNA). Well, we have three billion letters! So many that if we were to write the letters on sheets of paper and stack them all up, the height of all those sheets would be that of a multi-storey building.",
    "section2.title": "2. The genetic diseases",
    "section2.text1": "Genetic diseases occur when there is a problem with those instructions. When cells divide, they have to make a copy of their DNA. This copying process often has errors. This - which looks like a problem - is an advantage because it is how evolution works and has made it possible for different species to develop, although it can also, as we will see, produce diseases.",
    "section2.text2": "At the moment of sperm or egg division, each of us undergoes between 50 and 100 changes, called mutations. If these mutations occur in a minor part of the manual, we will not notice a major change. But if the mutation falls in a major area of the manual, the instructions in this case do change substantially and then two things can happen:",
    "section2.item1": "if these new instructions make the furniture we build have some advantage, Ikea will incorporate them and the following versions of the furniture will incorporate it and will be better furniture. It is the way living beings adapt to the environment, evolve and produce new species.",
    "section2.item2": "if the mutation makes the instructions to cause a drawer not to close properly, a handle to be missing or a piece not to fit properly we will have a disease since the protein will not work properly and will cause a problem in the body.",
    "section3.title": "3. The genetic tests",
    "section3.text1": "A genetic test is designed to find out if our furniture building instructions have any problems. Now we're going to quickly explain the different types of genetic tests that exist today.",
    "section3.subte1": "Kariotype.",
    "section3.text2": "By carrying out this test we check if we have the 23 pairs of shelves and the two extra chromosomes according to sex. Sometimes we are missing a whole shelf and sometimes we have an extra shelf. Sometimes we are even missing a whole piece of a shelf. This is the first genetic test that was done and geneticists only need a microscope and a lot of skill to see the chromosomes. For example, Down's Syndrome - where there are three shelves of chromosome 21 - is diagnosed this way. Warning!! Just because they do this test does not mean that our genetic information is right, because they are only looking at the shelves to see if they are correct and not broken. They're not looking at the books, the pages or the letters.",
    "section3.subte2": "Sanger test.",
    "section3.text3": "It soon became apparent that it would be interesting to open the books and see if they had all the chapters, all the pages and all the letters. Fortunately, a technique was developed that allowed this to be done and geneticists could check the letters of a book. It was the most accurate technique until about ten years ago. The problem I had was that you could only look at one book at a time. The doctor had to look at the patient's symptoms and if they were related to a problem in a piece of furniture the doctor would look at that book and see if all the letters, all the instructions were OK. It was a laborious, slow and expensive task because you had to go letter by letter, but the big problem I had was that if the book was right we were back at the beginning of the road. We had to go through each book and remember that there are more than 20,000 books. This test is called Sanger after the scientist who discovered it. It's made to look at a single gene.",
    "section3.subte3": "Array.",
    "section3.text4": "The scientists realized that many diseases were caused by problems in the same chapters of the books. Faced with the need to look at several hundred books at once, they developed a technique capable of doing so, but only in specific parts as it was very expensive to read all the letters. By means of an array we can analyze books on all the shelves, but only very specific parts where we know there may be errors. If the error is elsewhere in the book we will not see it and the patient will remain undiagnosed.",
    "section3.subte4": "NGS (Next Generation Sequencing).",
    "section3.text5": "Since 2005, computers have come to change everything. A technique was developed that allowed the analysis of all the letters in all the books on all the shelves. As there are three billion letters and also with several copies, it takes a lot of computing power to do so. Humans can't do it, but computers can. Within the NSW right now there are three types:",
    "section3.item1": "Panel. In a panel you select a few hundred genes, or books in our case, and look at all the letters or all the instructions in each of the books. One by one. With that we can see if these genes have errors or not. We won't know if there are errors in other books, but at least we can rule out some of them. Usually doctors do these tests when they suspect a disease or a group of diseases. If we have a leak in a house upstairs we would look at all the components in the bathroom, but we would not look at the drawers in the living room.",
    "section3.item2": "Medical exome. It's a panel, but already with thousands of books. All the books that we know are related to known diseases. It allows us to diagnose diseases that have a gene and clearly connected symptoms. It's like looking at all the furniture in a house, maybe they have nothing to do with the problem, but anyway we look at them to see if we see something.",
    "section3.item3": "Exom. Here you look at all the books and see that all the letters are there. If we find a problem in a book that we know what furniture it makes and that furniture has a problem, then we have a diagnosis. If we find a problem in a book, but we don't know very well the function of the furniture inside the house, we won't be able to confirm the diagnosis, but we will have a suspicion. We will have to wait to see the result of this problem in more houses and see if the same symptoms are generated.",
    "section3.item4": "Genome. To jump from the exome to the genome I have to confess that I haven't told you everything. On the shelves, besides the books, there is much more information. Imagine that it is the shelf in your house where you have kept papers, bills, school notes, etc. It is information that is in our DNA but that many times we don't know what it does and what it is for. In a genome we analyze books, but we also read these papers. Right now, we don't know what it's good for, but we store the information because in the future science can tell us after storing huge amounts of data. One of the functions attributed to these roles, called introns, is that they contain the information of when each book should be read.",
    "section3.text6": "The biological reality is much more complicated and there are more possible genetic problems than those I have described. But we hope this information will help you to clarify concepts and make your next furniture purchase more entertaining.",
